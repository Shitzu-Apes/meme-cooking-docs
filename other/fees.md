# ðŸ’¸ Fees

There are 2 fees on the platform:

1. **Protocol Fee:** When you deposit NEAR to a token, 0.5% of the NEAR is taken as a fee for the protocol. The protocol earns this fee even if the token is not launched.
2. **Early Withdrawal Fee:** If you decide to paper-hand your tokens before they even launched, 2% of your NEAR deposit is locked and distributed to other people who deposited NEAR to this token, when the launch period ends (regardless of whether it launches or fails).
