# ðŸ’¸ Fees

There are 2 fees on the platform:

1. **Protocol Fee:** When you deposit NEAR to a token, 0.5% of the NEAR is taken as a fee for the protocol. The protocol earns this fee even if the token is not launched.
2. **Early Withdrawal Fee:** If you decide to paper-hand your tokens before they even launched, 2% of your NEAR deposit is locked and distributed to other people who deposited NEAR to this token, when the launch period ends (regardless of whether it launches or fails).

Additionally there are Near Protocol native fees:

1. **Storage Staking:** A recoverable one-time payment of 0.045 NEAR is required to register your account in our Smart Contract. Additionally creating a meme token also incurs unrecoverable storage staking fee depending on how much data needs to be stored.
2. **Transaction/Gas Fee:** Approximately 0.001 NEAR per deposit and similar costs for other transactions.
