# üç¥ Referral System

Referrers get half of the [protocol fee](/other/fees) (0.25% of user deposited NEAR), so there's no difference for the users whether to use a referral or ordinary link.

To get the referral link, open your profile by clicking your account name in the top right corner:

![](/assets/profile.webp)

You can copy your link by clicking here:

<figure class="content-center"><img src="/assets/referral.webp" alt=""><figcaption class="caption"><p>The link will look like <a href="https://meme.cooking/board?referral=slimedragon.near">https://meme.cooking/board?referral=slimedragon.near</a></p></figcaption></figure>

Referral information is stored for 2 weeks, and after this, you'll have to send your referrers a link again, or you'll stop receiving referral payouts.
