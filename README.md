Meme.Cooking is a permissionless meme token launchpad on Near Protocol with the goal of being truly fair and rug-proof.
This is achieved through a fair, auction-based launch model where, unlike the popular Bonding Curve model, every depositor buys at the same price.
In addition, all NEAR deposited during the auction is used to create a liquidity pool and the LP shares are locked.
After the auction, the token will be launched on [Ref Finance](https://app.ref.finance) with the same initial price as during the auction if at least 4k NEAR has been deposited.

Meme.Cooking is built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Shitzu](https://shitzuapes.xyz/).
