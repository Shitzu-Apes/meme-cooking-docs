# ðŸ˜§ How Not To Get Rugged

Meme.cooking protects you from sniping and rug pulls:

1. It doesn't matter if you were the first or the last person to buy a token â€” the price will be the same for everyone. This prevents insiders from sniping the token and gives everyone an equal opportunity.
2. The LP for all tokens is owned by Meme.cooking, and is locked for 8 years after launch, so rug pulls are impossible.
3. After the launch, the price is just a bit lower than the pre-launch price (because of 0.5% fee), so being the first to dump after the launch is not going to make you any profit.

Check the [How It Works](for-buyers/how-it-works) page for more details.

But as always, if the dev decides to abandon the project, and community takeover doesn't happen, there is always a risk of soft rug.
